%% An interface function for calling the C function which does all the work.
%% The stationaty distribution PI is fixed after calling the C function. 
%% The function has many many input AND output variables. Below is their description:
%%
%% Output (this is the easier part ...):
%% -------------------------------------
%% PI - The stationary Markov distribution
%% M - The Markov transition matrix
%% N - The Emission/Noise matrix
%% MEW - The means of the contunuous (Gaussian) outputs
%% SIGMA - The st.ds. of the continuous (Gaussian) outputs.
%% LogScore - The log-likelihood of the optimal model
%% 
%% Input (Many many variables and flags ...)
%% -------------------------------------
%% DataVec - First data intensity (A chrom) 
%% DataVec2 - Secont data intensity (B chrom)
%% locations - Chromosomal locations
%% use_locations - Flag saying if the model should use these chromosomal locations
%% HMM_x_dim - Dimension of the Markov state space
%% HMM_y_dim - Dimension of the observations OR number of Gaussians in the observation mixture
%% place_flag - Whether to use place-dependent matrix information or not.
%% do_fold_change - should we do fold change? when? why? ???
%% mean_vec_rep - The means of the Y's if using place flag - Given as input and not learned (in our SNP case irrelevant) 
%% std_vec_rep - The st.d.s of the Y's if using place flag - Given as input and not learned (in our SNP case irrelevant)
%% PLACE_M - the place-dependent Markov matrices
%% SPECIAL_MODELS_FLAG - flag indicating if we have some taylored specific Markov Model for SNPs
%% M_UPPERBOUNDS - An upperbound on the transition matrix. This is used in order to avoid 'Singular' models 
%% USE_BOUNDS - Whether or not to use the upperbounds and avoid singularity
%% num_EM_iters - Number of EM iterations to perform
%% num_EM_starting_points - Number of different EM (random) sarting points
%% EM_tolerance - The improvement in score we require. If it's lower then we stop
