This package computes several properties of one-stage and two-stage selection procedures. 


The package is part of the larger MatUils package, and some functions here depend on MatUtil. Therefore, to install the package 
it is recommended to download and install the entire MatUtils package from here: 
https://github.com/orzuk/MatUtils

The package was used in the paper: 

[1] [On The Asymptotic Efficiency of Selection Procedures for Independent Gaussian Populations](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ejs/1514430422) <br />
R. Jacobovic and O. Zuk. Electronic Journal of Statistics 11(2): 5375-5405 (2017) 

In particular, the script [AsymptoticSelectionFigures.m](AsymptoticSelectionFigures.m) generates all figures shown in the paper. 

The script saves tables available in the [data](data) directory:  <br>
[data/N_star_numerics.txt](data/N_star_numerics.txt) shows values appearing in Figure 1 in the paper.   <br>
[data/h1_h2_numerics.txt](data/h1_h2_numerics.txt) shows values appearing in Figure 2 in the paper.
