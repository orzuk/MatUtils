% Fit a Mixture of Gaussians model to a given data and find model dimension given initial guess.
% It tries different dimensions (# of Gaussians), until it finds the best one.
% The score used is the MDL score, thus giving a likelihood
% term and a model complexity term.
% The method for maximum likelihood (for each dimension) is using EM algorithm. 
%
% Input:
% x - input data vec
% num_of_gaussians - # gaussians in the model
% num_of_iterations - # iterations to perform in the EM algorithm
% num_starting_points - # different (random) starting points for the EM algorithm
%
% Output: 
% P - the probs. of each gaussian
% M - the means
% S - the st.ds 
% LogLike - the loglikelihood score of the fit (higher is better)
