% Generate random samples from a BNT (given as a distribution) using mcmc 
% my_mcmc_sample_bnet_counts Generate many random samples from a Bayes net, (which is already given as a distribution)
% of size nsamples, and the number of samples is given by num_iters
%
% Here the sampling is done using monte-carlo markov chain simulations
% sample(i,j) contains the count of the i'th node in the j'th sample vec
% Nodes are sampled in the order given by bnet.order.
% Note : This is a special-purpose sampling function for fast sampling of
% small BINARY discrete BNT !!!! We also assume we have less than 32 nodes,
% so that each sample can fit into one word !!!!!!
% It is not good for the general case.
% Note : Unlike the usual sample_bnet, this function returns an matrix and
% not a cell-array
%
% num_samples is the number of samples to draw from the distribution.
% num_iters is the number of repetitions to do when sampling, so we get
% num_iters different samplings, each of size num_samples.
% We now do it in the new way. Note that now the function returns the
% sufficient statistics, or the sample counts (NOT normalized by the number of samples taken),
% and NOT the entire sample !!!!  This is for now
% good only for small BNETs. Thus we do not need to collect the samples later
