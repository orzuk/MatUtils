% Find the matches to position weight matrices in a given set of sequences.
%
% Note: this function is not so useful anymore and barely used. Please use
% the function 'find_best_pwm_matches_in_sequences_pack' which offers
% similar functionality and much more user friendly interface
%
% seqs is an array of the promoters sequences, represented as digits from 1
% to 4. pwms is a cell array of the matrices we use in order to look for
% binding sites. thresholds is a vector of threshold determining when to
% accept a 'hit' as a binding site. (For each pwm we put a different
% threshold). smart_threshold is a flag, if it is one the program
% calculates the best threshold automatically and ignores the threshold
% vetor given by the user. do_log is a flag saying if to take the logaritm
% of the pwms. If they are for example probabilities, we need the do_log
% flag to be one.
%
% Input: 
% seqs - a vector of sequences (in packed form)
% seqs_lens - the length of the sequences
% pwms - a set of pwms
% thresholds - which threshold to use to declare a hit 
% smart_thresholds - flag saying if to determine the threshold alone
% do_log - flag saying if to do log to the pwms
% strand - which strand to look for (???)
%
% diff_lengths_flag - flag saying if each sequence is of different length or not 
% 
% Output: 
% BS_united - a structure containig all the binding sites which passed the thresholds
