% Compute a 'hit' threshold for each pwm
% such that on average,
% a fraction of alpha of random sequences (currently i.i.d.)
% will recieve a pwm score abouve this threshold
%
% Input:
% pwms - the pwms
% alpha - the fraction of sites passing the threshold.
% This flag is optional. If it isn't given, this number is computed from the pwms,
% based on its information content, via the formula: alpha = 1 / 2^IC
% iters - how many iterations (random sequences generated) to use
% background_model - a singletons model for generating background sequences (optional - default is [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25])
%
% Output:
% pwms_thresholds - a threshold for each pwm such that a fraction alpha is above it
% pwms_alpha_vec - the fraction of sites expected to be above the thresholds
%
