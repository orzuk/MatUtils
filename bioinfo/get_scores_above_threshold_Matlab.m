% Get all the binding sites for a given motif which are
% above a certain threshold. It uses as its input the output of the function 'calc_all_sites_scores'
% It support both kinds of thresholding : Absolute (given value) or fractional
% (given fraction)
% We also output the threshold since it may be used for other blocks
% This function doesn't do any actual work, but serves as an interface to
% the c function (mex file) with the same name
%
% Input:
% loc_scores - matrix/cell-array of location scores
% loc_scores_length - vector of lengths of the different regions
% threshold - the threshold above which we consider a 'hit'
% L - the length of the Binding Site
% smart_threshold - the function can determine the threshold herself.
%   The options for smart threshold are the following:
%       -1 - pick the singel best instance of loc_scores (in each member of the cell array)
%       0 - pick the input threshold given from outside : 'threshold'
%       1 - choose threshold in a smart way. Treat 'threshold' as the top fraction above which we keep sites
%       2 - choose threshold in a smart way, such that exactly k scores pass, where k is the 'threshold' parameter
% diff_lengths_flag - saying if the regions are of different lengths
%
% Output :
% BS_genes - indices to genes containing the thresholds
% BS_places - places where the BS were found
% BS_scores - scores of the found BS
% thresh_output - the 'optimal' threshold as computed by the function (if it was required to do so)
