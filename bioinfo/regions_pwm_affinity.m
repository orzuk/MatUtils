% Compute affinity of a DNA sequence to a pwm.
% We check the local affinity at each position and do some weighted sum
% over them where the relative strentgh of the site is determined by the
% 'temperature' random variable beta. Higher beta means that most sites are
% about the same whereas lower beta means that only the very strong sites
% contribute.
% In addition, we also can incorparate the conservation information, such
% that a site 'match' is determined by both the affinity to the pwm and
% it's total conservation.
%
% Input:
% pwm - the motif's pwm
% packed_seqs - the sequences to search for (in a  packed form)
% seqs_lens - a vector of sequences lengths
% do_log - flag saying if to log-transform the pwms
% strand - which strand to look for (should be both)
% beta - the temperature. -1 means threshold some affinity, -2 means take best site
% loglike_mat - a conservation measure (optional).
% alpha - top fraction of conserved to consider (optional. Default is 0.05)
%
% Output:
% regions_affinity - a number representing the total affinity of the regions to the pwm
%
