% Calculate the pairwise similarity matrix between all pairs
% of pwms where one is from PWMS 1 and the other from PWMS2.
% The difference here is that the sizes of the PWMS in PWMS2 can be different
% One can choose the metric to use. currently supported are Euclidian
% metric and LogLikelihood similarity,
% which gives more weight to the more informative positions in the matrix.
% The PWMS are given in the following format: Matrices of 4*L. So we need
% to convert them to 'vectors'
% The similarity is used for example for the Affinity Propagation
% clustering algorithm by Frey and Dueck
% max_shift is the maximal shift we move the pwms with respect to each
% other - we choose the shift which gives the best similarity 
% We give all shifts score - we assume we just do here one sequence 
% (so one PWMS1) but the number of pwms (PWMS2) can be anything
