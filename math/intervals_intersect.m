% Compute the intersection between two sets of intervals
%
% Input:
% start_pos1 - starts of first interval set
% end_pos1 - ends of first interval set
% start_pos2 - starts of second interval set
% end_pos2 - ends of second interval set
% in_c_flag - use internal c function (faster. Default)
% is_sorted - assume arrays are sorted and don't sort (default false) 
%
% Output:
% intersect_start_pos - starts of intersection
% intersect_end_pos - ends of intersection
% intersect_inds1 - indices of intersect intervals in first intervals
% intersect_inds2 - indices of intersect intervals in second intervals
%
